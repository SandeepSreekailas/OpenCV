# OpenCV Basics with Python 👁️🐍

This repository contains my learning notes and practice code for **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision)** using Python.

## 📌 What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is a computer vision library used to process images and videos.  
It helps computers read, analyze, and understand visual data.

## 📌 What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is a field of computer science that enables machines to see and interpret images and videos like humans.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python
